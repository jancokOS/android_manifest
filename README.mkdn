jancokOS
===========

Getting Started
---------------

To get started with Android/jancokOS, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](https://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html).

To initialize your local repository using the jancokOS trees, use a command like this:

    repo init -u https://github.com/jancokOS/android_manifest.git -b jlos

Then to sync up:

    repo sync -j4 --force-sync
    
To build, use:
    mka -jX bacon
